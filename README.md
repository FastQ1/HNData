# HNData
This project is public to demonstrate the backend code. I discourage trying to replicate this project, as it's functionality is contigent on a certain database schema. Furthermore, this project makes lives queries. It's not fair to them to make more than a minimal amount of automated queries to their site.
If you're interested in the data, I will shortly post a link where you can see quite a bit of analyzed and live data. If you are personally interested in any stats, feel free to reach out via my portfolio site at https://www.patrick-sullivan.info
